## Step 1:
- Clone the repository using the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shikspanks41/Test-Repo.git
  ```

## Step 2:
- Ensure that PHP is installed on your system. Verify by running:
  ```bash
  php -v
  ```

## Step 3:
- Run the PHP script in the root of the repository:

  php script.php
  ```
  - This will remove the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files from the tag that was created with the current timestamp.
